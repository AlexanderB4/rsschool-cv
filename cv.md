## About Me
I have entered the IT sphere after practicing in filmmaking and clip production. I am acknowledged with any program for creation of the visual of future - from 3D models integration to a gamedev tools, such as Unreal Engine 4 and AR / VR implementation.

Had worked as PM at the video production. Have an experience of organizing others work and delegating tasks. 

Also, my experience has shown that socialising is my native skill, and I will be able to easily enter the new team and become an inseparable part of it literally in a few days. 

Also, realise how important it is to maintain teamâ€™s self-sufficiency and independence, thus, in case you face a problem with the right person it would be solved literally in a matter of hours, or weeks ;)
